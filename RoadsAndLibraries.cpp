/*
Determine the minimum cost to provide library access to all citizens of HackerLand. There are  cities numbered from  to . Currently there are no libraries and the cities are not connected. Bidirectional roads may be built between any city pair listed in . A citizen has access to a library if:

Their city contains a library.
They can travel by road from their city to a city containing a library.
Example

The following figure is a sample map of HackerLand where the dotted lines denote possible roads:

The cost of building any road is , and the cost to build a library in any city is . Build  roads at a cost of  and  libraries for a cost of . One of the available roads in the cycle  is not necessary.

There are  queries, where each query consists of a map of HackerLand and value of  and . For each query, find the minimum cost to make libraries accessible to all the citizens.

Function Description

Complete the function roadsAndLibraries in the editor below.
roadsAndLibraries has the following parameters:

int n: integer, the number of cities
int c_lib: integer, the cost to build a library
int c_road: integer, the cost to repair a road
int cities[m][2]: each  contains two integers that represent cities that can be connected by a new road
Returns
- int: the minimal cost

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer , that denotes the number of queries.

The subsequent lines describe each query in the following format:
- The first line contains four space-separated integers that describe the respective values of , ,  and , the number of cities, number of roads, cost of a library and cost of a road.
- Each of the next  lines contains two space-separated integers,  and , that describe a bidirectional road that can be built to connect cities  and .

Constraints

Each road connects two distinct cities.

Explanation

Perform the following  queries:

HackerLand contains  cities and can be connected by  bidirectional roads. The price of building a library is  and the price for repairing a road is .
image

The cheapest way to make libraries accessible to all is to:

Build a library in city  at a cost of .
Build the road between cities  and  at a cost of .
Build the road between cities  and  at a cost of .
This gives a total cost of . Note that the road between cities  and  does not need to be built because each is connected to city .

In this scenario it is optimal to build a library in each city because the cost to build a library is less than the cost to build a road.

There are  cities, so the total cost is .
